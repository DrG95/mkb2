Specifically, Hall effect switches have a magnet inside that interacts with a magnetic sensor that determines how far the magnet is, while optical keyboards use an infrared emitter and receiver to monitor the state of the switch (Think of those spy action movie scenes where the characters have to dodge the lasers otherwise the alarm rings. Same principle. really). When the switch is pressed, the internal stem descends and triggers the relative sensor. Both these technologies allow for an analogue reading of the key's state (aka not only it can be determined whether a key is being pressed, but also how far it is being pressed), allowing many particular interactions that are not possible with traditional keyboards (i.e. one can make a character in a game walk or sprint only based on how hard they press the movement key)</p>"},{"location":"keyboards/index.html#pros-and-cons-of-analogue-ish","title":"Pros and Cons of analogue-ish","text":"Pros of analogue-ishCons of analogue-ish <ul> <li>Very rich in features</li> <li>As the overall construction is similar to mechanic keebs, they share the same potential for customization and repairability</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Few manufacturers make those kinds of devices</li> <li>Very expensive compared to other types of keyboard</li> <li>As for now the customization is actually limited due to poor selection of options</li> </ul>"},{"location":"keyboards/anatomy.html","title":"Anatomy of mechanical keyboards","text":"<p>The main components of a mechanical keyboard are:</p> <ol> <li>Switches</li> <li>Keycaps</li> <li>The circuit </li> <li>A plate </li> <li>The stabs</li> <li>The case</li> </ol>"},{"location":"keyboards/anatomy.html#switches","title":"Switches","text":"<p>Arguably the most important component of a mechanical keyboard; the switches are the most responsible for determining the feel of the keyboard.

As already mentioned throughout the docs, this usually consists of a PCB, a rigide piece of material with conductive traces, on which the switches and the controller are mounted (can be soldered or socketed) Homemade keyboards can be handwired, meaning that \"loose\" wires are used to connect the switches to the controller and are soldered by hand. (Never would have guessed that's what \"hand-wired\" means, huh?)</p>"},{"location":"keyboards/anatomy.html#plates","title":"Plates","text":"<p>A piece of rigid material with square holes that switches and stabs snap into.
