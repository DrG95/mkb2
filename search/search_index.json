Specifically, Hall effect switches have a magnet inside that interacts with a magnetic sensor that determines how far the magnet is, while optical keyboards use an infrared emitter and receiver to monitor the state of the switch (Think of those spy action movie scenes where the characters have to dodge the lasers otherwise the alarm rings. Same principle. really). When the switch is pressed, the internal stem descends and triggers the relative sensor. Both these technologies allow for an analogue reading of the key's state (aka not only it can be determined whether a key is being pressed, but also how far it is being pressed), allowing many particular interactions that are not possible with traditional keyboards (i.e. one can make a character in a game walk or sprint only based on how hard they press the movement key)</p>"},{"location":"overview/index.html#pros-and-cons-of-analogue-ish","title":"Pros and Cons of analogue-ish","text":"Pros of analogue-ishCons of analogue-ish <ul> <li>Very rich in features</li> <li>As the overall construction is similar to mechanic keebs, they share the same potential for customization and repairability</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Few manufacturers make those kinds of devices</li> <li>Very expensive compared to other types of keyboard</li> <li>As for now the customization is actually limited due to poor selection of options</li> </ul>"},{"location":"overview/anatomy.html","title":"Anatomy of mechanical keyboards","text":"<p>The main components of a mechanical keyboard are:</p> <ol> <li>Switches</li> <li>Keycaps</li> <li>The circuit </li> <li>A plate </li> <li>The stabs</li> <li>The case</li> </ol>"},{"location":"overview/anatomy.html#switches","title":"Switches","text":"<p>Arguably the most important component of a mechanical keyboard; the switches are the most responsible for determining the feel of the keyboard.

As already mentioned throughout the docs, this usually consists of a PCB, a rigide piece of material with conductive traces, on which the switches and the controller are mounted (can be soldered or socketed) Homemade keyboards can be handwired, meaning that \"loose\" wires are used to connect the switches to the controller and are soldered by hand.

That's when an American-German company named Cherry started manufacturing computer keyboards, after the approval of their patent for a \"Momentary push button switch with improved non-conductive cam for normally retaining movable leaf spring contacts in a non-operative position\". That's a lof of words to describe a spring-loaded plastic shaft that separates two pieces of conductive material until phisically pressed. This contraption would be used as an actuator in early computer keyboards, in times when consumer electronics was hardly a thing. But as time passed, the demand for electronic devices and peripherals went up, and the limitations of such designs showed up in terms of manufacturing costs. In the 80s a new alternative came into the market, and that would be membrane actuators, those were cheap to manufacture, cheap to sell, decently reliable, and have been a staple in mass production since then.</p>"},{"location":"overview/switches.html","title":"Switches","text":""},{"location":"overview/switches.html#lets-switch-it-up-shall-we","title":"Let's switch it up, shall we?","text":"<p>Can't really say that they come in all shapes and sizes, but they do come in many different colors and color combinations.
