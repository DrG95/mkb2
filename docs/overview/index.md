# Overview

On a fundamental level, a keyboard is a device that has keys (duh) and an embedded chip that registers when keys are pressed, sending a corresponding signal to the host device (aka your PC)
Most PC Keyboards belong to one of two main categories, differentiating themselves by their actuation mechanism, being:

* membrane
* mechanical

### Membrane keyboards
Membrane keyboards have been (and still are) the staple keyboard for everyone. Think of a laptop keyboard, or those cheap keyboards you can find in every office or school lab. Yup, pretty much each of those is a membrane keyboard. 

#### How a membrane keyboard works
This kind of keyboard features a soft membrane (hence its name) that flexes when a key is pressed,slides through a plastic separation layers and makes contact with a conductive layer underneath, closing a circuit that tells the embedded controller which key is being pressed

#### Pros and Cons of membrane

=== "Pros of membrane keyboards"

    * They're cheap
    * They're relatively quiet

=== "Cons of membrane keyboards"

    * They DO feel cheap
    * The whole keeb needs to be replaced when the membrane is damaged
    * Many membrane keyboards don't have important QoL features such as NKRO, although this hardly has much to do with the membrane mechanism itself, it's worth noting

### Mechanical keyboards
As you may have guessed, we're all about mechanical here.
This kind of keyboard is very popular among gamers and dedicated typers for their features and the various aesthetics that this type of build can achieve.

#### How a mechanical keyboard works
The main thing about mechanical keyboard is that each key has its own switch that is placed on the circuit (Usually a PCB, but a mechanical keyboard can be handwired as well) and the actuation happens within the mechanical construction inside the switch itself. Switches for mechanical keyboard are usually interchangeable and based on the model can be easily swapped out, for repairability and customization purpose.

#### Pros and Cons of mechanical

=== "Pros of mechanical keyboards"

    * Highly customizable both in features, layouts and aesthetics
    * Can be easier to repair although it depends on the model
    * Vast se;ection on the market
    * You can actually build your own

=== "Cons of mechanical keyboards"

    * Can be very expensive compared to membrane keyboards
    * Potentially pretty noisy (there are ways to prevent this, however)

### Other keyboards
Although pretty niche, there are other kinds of keyboards that are worth mentioning, as slowly but surely these devices are gaining popularity in certain specific environments (notably professional gamers)
These are **Optical** and **Hall Effect** keyboards. I'll treat them as one big category of *analogue-ish* keyboards, as they follow a common philosophy, despite their inner workings being different

#### *Analogue-ish* keyboards?
Instead of relying on hardware closing and opening a circuit to register key presses, both optical and Hall effect keyboards make use of (usually analogue) sensors to perceive when a key is being pressed.
Specifically, Hall effect switches have a magnet inside that interacts with a magnetic sensor that determines how far the magnet is, while optical keyboards use an infrared emitter and receiver to monitor the state of the switch (Think of those spy action movie scenes where the characters have to dodge the lasers otherwise the alarm rings. Same principle. really). When the switch is pressed, the internal stem descends and triggers the relative sensor. Both these technologies allow for an analogue reading of the key's state (aka not only it can be determined whether a key is being pressed, but also how far it is being pressed), allowing many particular interactions that are not possible with traditional keyboards (i.e. one can make a character in a game walk or sprint only based on how hard they press the movement key)

#### Pros and Cons of *analogue-ish*

=== "Pros of *analogue-ish*"

    * Very rich in features
    * As the overall construction is similar to mechanic keebs, they share the same potential for customization and repairability

=== "Cons of *analogue-ish*"

    * Few manufacturers make those kinds of devices
    * Very expensive compared to other types of keyboard
    * As for now the customization is actually limited due to poor selection of options
