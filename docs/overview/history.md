# A brief history of computer keyboards (WiP)

The design of modern mechanical keyboards and switches dates all the way back to the 1970s.
That's when an American-German company named Cherry started manufacturing computer keyboards, after the approval of their patent for a "Momentary push button switch with improved non-conductive cam for normally retaining movable leaf spring contacts in a non-operative position". That's a lof of words to describe a spring-loaded plastic shaft that separates two pieces of conductive material until phisically pressed. This contraption would be used as an actuator in early computer keyboards, in times when consumer electronics was hardly a thing. But as time passed, the demand for electronic devices and peripherals went up, and the limitations of such designs showed up in terms of manufacturing costs. In the 80s a new alternative came into the market, and that would be membrane actuators, those were cheap to manufacture, cheap to sell, decently reliable, and have been a staple in mass production since then.
