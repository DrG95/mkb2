# Switches

###### *Let's switch it up, shall we?*

Can't really say that they come in all shapes and sizes, but they do come in many different colors and color combinations. Not that the looks matter that much when it comes to the switches.

In fact, three are the colors that do tell something about the switch: red, blue and brown, as per the o.g. Cherry MX models and their respective characteristic feedback: linear, clicky and tactile.

#### Linear switches
(some models referred as red), they have a smooth and consistent feedback all the way to the bottom. They are potentially the lightest and fastest kind of switch available, suitable especially for certain types of games, as well as silent applications.

#### Tactile switches
(Sometimes refferred as brown), feature a subtle bump that can be felt while pressing the key. These are, on average, heavier than linear switches, although it really depend on the manufacturer and the model. The tactility is usually appreciated by typists and light gamers alike, although some models can be tiring to use continuously.

#### Clicky switches
(Based on blue Cherrys), their feedback is comparable to the tactile switches, but on top of the tactile bump. they feature an audible clicky sound. For this, while they could theoretically be interchanged with the tactiles, they end up not being particularly popular as the noise can be annoying for some, notably in shared environments (Please note that any mechanical keyboards without the due care and technique can be loud and noisy, and thus unpleasant to some)

#### To each their own
While a typical use-case has been specified for each category of switch, ultimately the choice is strictly personal. There are literally hundreds if not thousands of mechanical switch available on the market, don't be afraid to test them out (Test kits can be of big help) and find out which kind/s of switches you like
