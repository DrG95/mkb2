# Anatomy of mechanical keyboards

The main components of a mechanical keyboard are:

1. Switches
2. Keycaps
3. The circuit 
4. A plate 
5. The stabs
6. The case

## Switches 

Arguably the most important component of a mechanical keyboard; the switches are the most responsible for determining the feel of the keyboard. By itself, a switch is just a plastic stem held up by a spring that pushes a small piece of metal, causing it to touch another small piece of metal when the key is pressed. Based on the internal construction, a switch can be **linear**, **tactile** or **clicky**.

## Keycaps

Almost as important as the switch itself, the keycaps are the plastic pieces that the fingers actually touch when interacting with the keyboards. They are hugely responsible for the whole look and feel of the keyboard, and the first component that can be modified when looking for an upgrade.

## Circuits

Well, all the switches have to be wired to a controller so that we actually have a working device, innit? As already mentioned throughout the docs, this usually consists of a PCB, a rigide piece of material with conductive traces, on which the switches and the controller are mounted (can be soldered or **socketed**) Homemade keyboards can be handwired, meaning that "loose" wires are used to connect the switches to the controller and are soldered by hand. (Never would have guessed that's what "hand-wired" means, huh?)

## Plates

A piece of rigid material with square holes that switches and stabs snap into. With PCBs this piece is actually optional, but is usually present nonetheless, as it helps keeping things stable and has an influence on the sound profile of the whole keyboard. Can be made of plastic or metal.

## Stabs

Short for stabilizers, those contraptions are used to support longer keys (such as the space, enter and backspace keys) to prevent them from wobbling sideways.

## Cases

Actually optional in most cases (pun intended), but you don't usually want to skip on one (unless you're going for a specific barebone look). It helps in keeping everything well tied together, and can be made of plastic, resin, metal (aluminum case are pretty popular) or, why not, even wood for more premium builds (plastic and resin being the most common as they are cheap to manufacture, even at home)
